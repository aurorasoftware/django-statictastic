Versioning
----------

This library supports both Python 2 and 3, but are maintained on two
separate branches and therefore you’ll need to specify which version you
want through your requirements file.

If you’re running on Python 3.0 or greater, use this:

::

   statictastic>=3.0

If you’re running on Python 2.7 or earlier, use the following instead:

::

   statictastic>=1.0,<=2.0
